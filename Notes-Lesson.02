Procedures and Control

Inputs -> Procedure -> Outputs
'''
I have later found out that the instructor is
stating procedures when they actually mean 
function. Functions are free to return a value 
or not. If they do not, None is returned 
automatically. Functions that return no value 
are called "procedures".

def name(parameters): #multiple parameters are seperated by ,'s

def sum(a, b):
    a = a + b

print sum(1, 1)
# Result is None


def sum(a, b):
    a = a + b

a = 2
b = 2
print sum(a, b)
# Still returns None
# "Procedures" pass the !value! of the variable.
